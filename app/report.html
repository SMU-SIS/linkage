                       <h5>Limitations of Controls</h5>
            			<p>Given the inherent limitations in any system of control, projection of any evaluation of the controls to future periods is subject to the risk that the control procedures may become inadequate because of changes in systems, conditions or the degree of compliance with those procedures. Therefore, constant monitoring is needed to ensure that system controls that exist remain effective over time.</p>
                        <h5>Limitations of Penetration Tests</h5>
                        <p>The penetration test was conducted over a limited period and the related test procedures were performed on the system at a single point of time.  As such, the scope was limited to the known vulnerabilities and system configuration during the work period. The penetration tests and vulnerability assessments may not yield any vulnerability. However that does not indicate that the system has no vulnerability exposure. New vulnerabilities may be discovered over time and therefore continuous and timely measures should be taken to aDCress them.</p>
